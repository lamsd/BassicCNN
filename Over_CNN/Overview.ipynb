Artificial neurons, a rough imitation of their biological counterparts, are mathematical functions that calculate the weighted sum of multiple inputs and outputs an activation value. When you input an image in a ConvNet, each layer generates several activation functions that are passed on to the next layer.\n",

    "Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data by reducing the dimensions. There are two types of pooling average pooling and max pooling. I’ve only had experience with Max Pooling so far I haven’t faced any difficulties.\n",

    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Since convolutional neural networks are typically used for image-classification, we are generally dealing with high-dimensional data (images). While the structure of a ConvNet aims to mitigate over-fitting, you generally need a large amount of data for a convolutional neural network to work effectively. Of course, the amount of data you need depends on the complexity of the task at hand.\n",
    "- Related to the first point, convolutional neural networks are probably overkill if the task at hand is very simple (i.e. how can we distinguish between white vs. black circles?). For very simple tasks, you are better off doing basic processing on OpenCV since it’s more quicker / efficient.\n",
    "- It takes a very long time to train a convolutional neural network, especially with large datasets. You generally need specialized hardware (like a GPU) to expedite the training process.\n",
    "- While CNNs are translation-invariant, they are generally bad at handling rotation and scale-invariance without explicit data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNN models are the golden standard for computer vision tasks since it does the feature extraction process for you. In the older days of computer vision, researchers used to manually extract features and implement classical ML algorithms (i.e. a simpler neural net, SVM) to do image classification tasks. However, CNN models generally perform superior compared to the manual extraction process (it’s end-to-end). There is research article online that discusses this topic in more detail here\n",
